# CoC Ressource
Rules, setting primers and more for the "Call of Cthulhu" pen and paper. Feel free to use and adapt these resources in whatever way you like! 

Navigation will be much easier if you use the headings in each document. Bravely click the list icon in the top right (⋮☰)! 

## Future Additions 
At the moment I have only included my own primer, but would be open about turning this into a collection. If you have created some resources you would like to include, just open an issue and we can see how they could fit in!
