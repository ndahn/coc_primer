# CoC Ressource
Rules, setting primers and more for the "Call of Cthulhu" pen and paper. Feel free to use and adapt these resources in whatever way you like! 

Navigation inside the files will be much easier if you use the headings in each document. Bravely click the list icon in the top right (⋮≡)! 

## Overview
1. [Rules Primer](Primer/rules_primer.md)
2. [Setting Primer](Primer/setting_primer.md)
3. [Lines and Veils](Primer/lines_and_veils.md)
4. [Character Creation](Primer/character_creation.md)

Keep in mind that it's not necessary to read everything. I tried to cover anything that may be of immediate interest. Especially in the setting primer I included a lot of details that won't be relevant to playing at all, but should hopefully give a better feeling of the 1920s if you want to delve a little deeper.  

## Future Additions 
At the moment I have only included my own primer, but would be open about turning this into a collection. If you have created some resources you would like to include, just open an issue and we can see how they could fit in!
