# CoC Ressource
Rules, setting primers and more for the "Call of Cthulhu" pen and paper. Feel free to use and adapt these resources in whatever way you like! 

## Future Additions 
At the moment I have only included my own primer, but would be open about turning this into a collection. If you have created some resources you would like to include, just open an issue and we can see how they could fit in!
