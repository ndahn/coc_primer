# Setting Primer
## The Fear of the Unknown 
Call of Cthulhu is based on a lovecraftian horror setting: what we perceive as reality is only a thin veil hiding a vast, uncaring cosmos ruled by alien gods. Humanity's only saving grace is our ignorance and the fact that these outer forces harbor only minor interest for us.

Players will typically take the role of investigators in the 1920s. Your characters usually won't be aware of the higher forces at work, nor will they get involved by choice - you just happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.

Racism was very common in this time and Lovecraft was no stranger to it, often making foreigners and people of color villains involved in dark arts and cults. This won't play a role in our sessions unless it's important for your character and everyone is cool with it. 

## 1920s Quick Overview
*Note:if critical for your character, please check the story hook to find out what year exactly the scenario will play in!*

People generally kept their word, handshake deals were a thing, violent crime not unheard of, but only city people locked their doors at night. Delicate statues in small towns went unmolested for decades.

Prohibition has made criminals out of most of the populace. 70% of people can be bribed according to their station and made to look the other way. Many cops are in on the take, acting like just another gang when it comes to extorting protection money from speakeasies.

Standards of decency played an important role. Sexual matters were not spoken of in polite company. Homosexuals risked their career, friends, reputation, even their physical safety. Children grew up largely innocent of the harsher world. 

Without much more than telephones and libraries, it's harder to be found, easier to disappear.
