# Rules Primer
I prefer playing Call of Cthulhu (CoC) as a narration-focused game, very light on rules (and certainly less than you may find in the rule book). 

## How To Die
As opposed to e.g. DnD, CoC is not combat, but **mystery focused**. The players take on the roles of investigators, typically in a 1920s **lovecraftian horror** setting. You will of course want to survive, but also solve the mystery and save everyone - not all of these may be possible.  

CoC can be quite brutal if you're not careful: the weakest enemy you will typically encounter is other humans, and they die just as fast as you do. Just to really drive this home: a hand gun does up to 1d12 damage, and your investigator will probably have 10-14 HP. Healing is much less generous as well and may take several weeks for severe injuries, with no guarantee of full recovery. **Death is a very real possibility**, although I don't intend to be cruel. 

The second resource you will have to keep an eye out for is your **sanity**. This usually starts somewhere in the 40s and will decline as your investigator has bizarre, gruesome or otherwise disturbing encounters. It is difficult to regenerate, and losing a lot of sanity at once may result in a **temporary bout of madness** or **permanent insanity**. It is up to you to include these traits in your role play and character's decisions. A character that has lost all their sanity is broken and won't be able to continue their investigation. 

## Resolving Challenges
Your character will have a number of skills that cover areas like driving, athletics, insight, persuasion, or, maybe most important, spot hidden, your investigation skill. These skills will usually be somewhere between 20-80. On a skill check, you will roll a **d100** and try to be **below your skill value**; essentially you're rolling how difficult the task is. If your skill is higher, you get a regular success, but if your skill is **2x** as high or even **5x** as high you have a hard/extreme success. 1 and 100 represent critical success and failure respectively, but are much less common and thus impactfull than in other RPGs. Opposed rolls depend on the "**level of success**", e.g. a hard success beats a regular success.

If you check your character sheet you may also find a luck stat. In addition to a stat you may have to roll for, it also serves as a resource. With few exceptions, you can almost always spend up to 10 luck on a skill check to improve your result. However, luck never regenerates - if your character has run out of luck, that's it! 

In general, don't let the rules distract you too much. If you want to do something, **just narrate it** and we'll figure out which skill fits best. For example, if your investigator tries to tail a suspect, you could use your sneak skill, but disguise, streetwise or spot hidden could work just as well depending on the approach and skill set of your character. 

## Leveling Up
In short: you don't. Since there are no special skills to use, the things you unlock will usually be story related. However, that doesn't mean you don't improve. After each session (or milestone), you will have an opportunity to improve the values of skills you successfully used since the last session or milestone. And of course there's the occasional enigmatic item of questionable origin to find... 

## Combat
Combat rules are kept simple as well. A melee attack can be dodged or countered, and a ranged attack can be evaded. Escape and physical tackles are also options. Since you won't have any special combat abilities like the "awesome backflip of fiery death", your investigator is **free to improvise** and make use of their environment to gain an advantage. Need something heavy to smash a window? Just give me a luck roll and there might be a fire extinguisher nearby!

## Magic
While there is magic, it is something **extremely dangerous and volatile**, likely to drain both your MP and sanity. Depending on the spell, you may even put yourself and others at mortal risk. Unless you have a very specific background, your characters won't be able to use or even be aware of the existence of magic. If you are (un-)lucky enough to learn a spell during your adventure, expect a heavy cost. 

## Have Fun! 
Last, but certainly not least, this game is supposed to be fun for everyone. To me, the game is most fun when I can get all of you excited about the story, and so I will do my best to give every player equal amounts of joy and dread :)
