# Character Creation 
## Lead Questions
Keep in mind that other players will only know about you what you tell or show them! 

- profession, age, gender? 
- what impression do you leave with others? 
- what does your everyday life look like? 
- what did you do during the great war (WW1)?
- what is your relation to the police? 
- what are your flaws and vices? 
- what do you want no one to find out? 
- what was your darkest moment? 

## Getting into the Thicket
For first time players and oneshots, I would suggest to not let your character struggle too much with getting involved, i.e. your character should have a reason to follow the hook and work with the others, even if they don't know each other yet. 

That being said, the entry point will typically not present itself as "hey, I am made from reality-bending space magic". Investigating a disappearance, chasing a news story or being in a situation where running away is simply not an option are all typical reasons for your character to get involved more than they may have wished to. In general, this reason will be provided by the story.

## Character Stats
In CoC, there are two sets of stats you will use throughout your adventure: your basic stats, which define your character's physical and mental build, and your skills, which represent to which degree your character has mastered certain abilities. 

As mentioned earlier, there is no strict way to use them. If a skill seems to match your challenge, you can probably use it! 

> The best you can do is try to use your choices as part of your role play. For example, to tell if someone is lying you could use psychology or fast talk or even listen or spot hidden. A successful roll would create the same outcome, but how your character got there will be different. 

### Stat Assignment
*You don't need to do this beforehand! I am happy to guide you through the process on our first session :)*

The easiest way to assign stats is called quickfire, in which you get a bunch of numbers for your basic stats and skills and then assign them freely. This method is described below. 

There are other ways to assign stats based on dice rolls and a point buying system. Drop me a message if this is more up your alley!

#### Basic Stats
For your basic stats, you would assign the following values to your *Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Appearance, Education, Size and (mental) Power* (higher is better):
> 80, 70, 60, 60, 50, 50, 50 40

There are a few secondary stats that will be calculated differently:
- HP: (Con + Siz) / 10
- Sanity: =Pow
- Luck: (2d6 + 6) x 5
- Movement Rate, Damage Bonus, etc.: influenced by your strength, dexterity and size

There will also be boni and mali to some stats based on your age. 

#### Skills
In addition, you can distribute a set of numbers across your skills. However, there are two special skills: 
- Credit Rating, i.e. how rich your character is): purely based on your background. Assign whatever makes sense to you here!
- Cthulhu Mythos, your character's understanding of what lies beyond. This will start at 0. You cannot assign points to it. 

Otherwise, just keep your occupation and background in mind and assign the following numbers:
> 70, 60, 60, 50, 50, 50, 40, 40, 40

Any skill you don't assign to will have a default value, usually around 20. However, you can additionally add another 20 to 4 of your skills. Consider these your character's hobbies.
